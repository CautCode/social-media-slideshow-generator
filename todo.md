To achieve an Excellent to Outstanding grade for the 002 Individual Coursework, your Proof of Concept (PoC) must focus on "novel aspects" rather than a fully finished product1.

Based on the rubric's demand for "tangible outputs" 2 and the specific feedback from your presentation, here is the succinct list of features required for this version:

1. Core AI & Content Features (Novelty)

**DONE WITH SEARCHING AS WELL**
Structured AI Content Generation: Use OpenAI to generate slide headlines, body text, and specific search keywords for each slide based on user input.

**DONE**
Automated Stock Photo Sourcing: Fully functional integration with the Pexels (or Pixabay) API to automatically fetch and display images based on AI-generated keywords.

**NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CREATES IT IN THE NECESSARY STYLE**
Template & Tone Engine: Logic that adjusts the generated content's style (e.g., "Minimal" vs. "Bold") and tone (e.g., "Professional" vs. "Humorous").

2. The Visual Editor (Tangible Output)

**DONE**
Interactive Canvas: A functional UI where users can see the slides and make live adjustments.

**DONE**
Text & Layout Controls: Ability to modify font size, color, alignment, and drag-and-drop text positioning555.

**DONE**
Image Modification: Sliders or inputs for adjusting brightness, contrast, and background overlay opacity6.

**DONE**
Slide Management: Drag-and-drop functionality to reorder slides and a thumbnail preview for navigation7.

**DONE**
3. Critical Technical Requirements (Passing Criteria)
Functional Export/Download: A mechanism to save the final slideshow as a file (e.g., PNG or PDF) so it is no longer just "session-based".

**DONE**
Image Replacement: A working sesarch bar within the editor to swap out AI-suggested images for different stock photos.
**STARTED**
Cloud Architecture Evidence: A diagram showing how the frontend (Next.js), backend, and APIs (OpenAI, Pexels, Clerk) interact.

4. Project Management & Process Evidence

**GITHUB and maybe notes app**
Version Control & Task Tracking: Evidence (like screenshots) of using GitHub for code management and a tool like Trello or Jira to track feature progress88.

**CLAUDE CODE**
GenAI Implementation: Documentation of how you used AI to assist in coding or debugging the system.

how to play with someone's mind

if someone is crying, ask them "do you want some sand?" confusion actually imrpoves mood.

making someone else believe you are mental will make them not want to deal with you. this is a great self defence trick

those that block you on social media are the most toxic people in your life. check who blocked you share > more > blocked

if you are in a ogrup setting and you notice that someone is mocking you, syare in their eyes and smile... they will feel scared

5 things she'll never tell you but secretly wants

1) she wants you to lead without conotrlling her. directions turn her on - control pushers her away

2) she craves reassurance more than you think. even the strongest women have silent douvts.

3) she needs to feel chosen even on your busiest days. it's not about time it's about effort

4) she watches how you treat her in private and public. Consistency means everything.

5) she doesn't need you perfect. she just needs you present.

the best mental health advice i was ever given

1) you don't need a breadk you need a life you don't want to escape from. Rest doesn't fix burnout when your whole routine is the problem.

2) stop venting to people who don't want to see you win. half of them are just glad it's you and not them.

3) get out of your head and into your body. the overthinking stops when you move. walk . lift. breathe. sweat. it's not that deep

4) your phone is the reason you feel so anxious. you scroll past 1000 people a day and wonder why you don't know who you are

5) if you wake up sad every day, stop sleeping next to chaos. fix your room. cut off the man. clean your space. energy is real.

6) you;re not broke. you're just overstimulated, and under-connectedt to yourself. turn the volume down on the world.

7) healing isn't cute. it's lonely. it's boring. it's silent. that's why most people never do it.

how i turned my life around in 2 years 
(my full transformation)

failed school and worked two jobs to make up for it...

dropped out to chase the vision of exactly who i wanted to become...

got kicked out and became homeless...

realised it's me against the world 
i had to do more...

started an SMMA (social media marketing agency)
it was hard at first until...

i signed my first client

that gave me the boost to keep pushing so i locked in...

started building relationships and connecting investors together...

hit 15k/month couldn't sleep for days...

started my private members club, MM Collective.

everything was good...
until i made the wrong decisions and lost it all.

felt like i lost myself...
the fire, the drive, even my smile

went back to the drawing board... and made a comeback

started giving back, buying things for people around me that i always wanted to

met some of the biggest names in the game

remember 
god has a plan for each of us. even when it feels like everything is falling aparts, he's just setting us up for something greater. trust in him, keep pushing, and never give up your breakthrough is coming
